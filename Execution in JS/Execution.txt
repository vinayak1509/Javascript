Whenever a code is executed, the first thing that happens is the creation of global execution context....

Broadly, there are three types of execution contexts:
1. Global execution context
2. Function execution context
3. Eval execution context

Steps in execution:
1. Global execution context creation.
2. Memory phase
3. Execution phase

Memory phase:
All the variables are allocated separate memory and they are assigned values undefined
functions are allocated their defination

Execution phase:
All the variables get the desired values , operations are performed.
Each time a function is created, a new execution context is created
